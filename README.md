# YOLO11_Object_Detection_with_Ultralytics
This project demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLO11 (You Only Look Once) architecture. It utilizes the ultralytics framework to identify and locate 80 different object categories within images.

🚀 Features
State-of-the-Art Model: Uses the high-accuracy yolo11x.pt (Extra Large) pre-trained model.

Broad Detection Range: Capable of detecting 80 different classes, including people, vehicles, animals, and common household items.

Seamless Visualization: Integrated with OpenCV and Matplotlib for clear image processing and display.

🛠️ Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:

ultralytics
opencv-python
matplotlib
numpy
